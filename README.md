# tak
I have loved reading the Kingkiller Chronicles, by Patrick Rothfuss, and while I increasingly-less-patiently await the release of Doors of Stone, I decided to have a crack at writing something to play Tak.
Tak is something in between Go, Checkers, but with a few unique twists. A friend brought a physical version on a weekend trip, and handily beat me in every game we played together.
